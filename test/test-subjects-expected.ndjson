The APAIS thesaurus was introduced in 1978 when APAIS became available as an online database and was first published by the National Library of Australia in 1980 to facilitate online searching. While still primarily used as an indexing tool, the APAIS thesaurus is an essential aid for efficient online searching of the APAIS and Australian Public Affairs - Full Text databases. Besides serving the APAIS clients the published Thesaurus has been adopted in a number of wider projects that require a structured list of Australian subject terms, such as the recommendation for its use for subject indexing when using the Australian Government Locator Service metadata standard.\""]},"languages":["en"],"modified":"2021-02-10T10:31:55.487Z","prefLabel":{"en":"Australian Public Affairs Information Service Thesaurus"},"publisher":[{"prefLabel":{"en":"National Library of Australia"},"uri":"http://viaf.org/viaf/136194678"}],"startDate":"1978","subject":[{"inScheme":[{"uri":"http://bartoc.org/en/node/241"}],"notation":["0"],"uri":"http://dewey.info/class/0/e23/","prefLabel":{"de":"Informatik, Informationswissenschaft & allgemeine Werke"}},{"inScheme":[{"uri":"http://bartoc.org/en/node/241"}],"notation":["001"],"uri":"http://dewey.info/class/001/e23/","prefLabel":{"de":"Wissen"}}],"topConcepts":[],"type":["http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#ConceptScheme","http://w3id.org/nkos/nkostype#thesaurus"],"uri":"http://bartoc.org/en/node/10","url":"http://www.nla.gov.au/apais/thesaurus/"}
